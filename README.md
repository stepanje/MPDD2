# Metal Parts Defect Detection Dataset 2 (MPDD2)


MPDD2 is a dataset aimed at benchmarking visual defect detection methods in industrial metal parts manufacturing. It consists of more than 700 images, which are divided into the training subset with anomaly-free samples and the validation subset that contains both normal and anomalous samples. The dataset can be downloaded at the following link.
